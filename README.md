# For People By People From People.

An open source project for the People of Bharat.

Have the vision to create an application where all the Shopkeepers and its cutomers can meet and do stuff without any third party being involved.
A self suffecient system to list and sell products easily.

Plan :
  ShopKeeper's POV
  Managae whole of the shop products and listing.
  can decide what and how he will charge for a particular delivery Ex. 50 ruppes for 1 km or 70 for 2 km. (independent delivery) Or a setup which can be created to deliver goods and same payment can be provided by the supplier 
  can decide discounts and general setting from the application
  can decide timing for auto open and close of the shops.




So here is a user scenario:
For ex:
  A person wants to buy Wheat flour.
    sc1: he is going to home
    sc2: He is at home
    sc3: he is some place far
    sc4: any other means

  Sol: 
    sc1: He can pickup from the shop while going to home.
    sc2: normal delivery where shopkeeper will accept his order and provide update on the same.
    sc3: sc 2 can be followed
    sc4: delivery can be made by shopkeepers side as per his conve. 

From above example we can understand that it provides shopkeepers a right to mangage whole operation and total control of his virtual shop.

Based on these orders and delivery a metric can be made so that in the listing and recommendation of shop can be increased and there is no partiality

Key Points:
  1. It will show near by shops
  2. it can list all the shops at particular location
  3. order can be picked up at selected time from customer.
  4. In short it a a virtual version of the existing shop and it gives control in many forms from order to shop handling 
  5. Location based recommedtion increases chances of all the shops listing (manage it in such a way that if some are being seen less they get priority)
  6. About the charges we will be charging only 1% from both shopkeepers and cutomers (For a good cause atleast they can provide that much)
  7. From this 1% we will be managing the whole operations and feed the needy.


Some Internal thoughts for the monetory gains which should be used to provide food to needy.
so for that I had a plan Like Open in each city at a location one by one place of worship where there will be no discremination against any religon and all the needy people can have food so that no one sleeps empty stomach.
This is basically personal view one can come up with another plan if we have one.
